Hi Roberto,

Thanks for the update, hopefully AzureNet can have a look soon.

Some extra information again: following the observed behaviour in the separate Azure tenant, I adjusted the "Hub routing preference" to "VPN" in our acceptance and production tenants earlier this week, but unfortunately child domain creation still fails in those tenants after that change. Therefore, it seems there are other factors involved as well, but it still seems likely that the problems do somehow relate to the Azure WAN and its network implications (or possibly a bug).

Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Good morning Jan, 
 
I'm waiting for an update from the AzureNet side so I can connect you with them, but I have not received anything from their side. Hopefully they will get to the case by end of day today or tomorrow, I cannot make any promises. I've also made a note so that they see the your troubleshooting you've done from the email you've sent me. 
 
Thank you for your patience.

Hi Roberto,
 
I've succeeded in breaking the child domain creation in the tenant mentioned in my mail from Tuesday where child domain creation was working properly.
 
The Windows child domain creation breaks specifically with a "Virtual WAN" resource added to the tenant which has a "Virtual HUB" resource within it which has its "Hub routing preference" set to "ExpressRoute" (through "Edit virtual hub"). When I set the "Hub routing preference" for this "Virtual HUB" back to "VPN", the Windows child domain creation works without issues again.
 
Since we have been making the shift to Azure WAN on our acceptance tenant in April with the "Hub routing preference" set to "ExpressRoute", it seems very likely that this is what is causing the problems in our acceptance and production tenants as well.
 
This seems like an Azure bug to me, since there is actually no relation between the VNET the domain controllers are in and the deployed Azure WAN resource for this reproduction. I would very much like to hear from the networking team if this is indeed the case and how we somehow can best work around this (or possibly make networking adjustments). I will also check with my colleagues next week what we can do to not use the "ExpressRoute" option.
 
Hope to hear from you or the Azure Networking team next week!
 
Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Good afternoon Jan, 
 
I just wanted to give you an update of what is happening. After speaking with the collaborating Azure net agent they need to find a engineer that deals with what you had previously mentioned an engineer with that is an expert in connectivity between Azure and On-Premise. We are working on getting them so that you can receive the best possible support. 
 
Also, as I asked on Tuesday, can you provide me the best times you can meet so that once, I get the message from the engineer. I have that info and we can schedule a call as soon as possible. 
 
Thank you again for your patience. 
My best,

Hi Roberto,

Thanks for the update! I'll be quite flexible this Thursday or Friday at Western European times (only Thursday from 13:00 to 14:00 does not fit), please let me know if they have time on those days.

Some extra information:

I can reproduce the problem in both our acceptance and production tenants:
"TOPdesk SaaS ACC", tenant/directory id: d87176a2-fbd8-4a8d-96ec-a0b4d0222299
"TOPdesk SaaS PROD", tenant/directory id: 473807c6-40e3-4b84-b3c3-49b847a3bbcb

But not in this tenant:
"TOPdesksaaspoc", tenant/directory id: 473807c6-40e3-4b84-b3c3-49b847a3bbcb

I've been suspecting this may somehow relate to networking changes we made moving to Azure WAN and VPN sites within that WAN for the first two mentioned tenants, but I cannot directly relate the time of those changes to the appearance of the problem.

I've tried deploying a WAN and hub in the last tenant "TOPdesksaaspoc" today (did not have time to try and replicate the whole situation with hubs and vpns), but I could still create a root/child AD domain as mentioned without problems there.

Hope this may already give some pointers for the AzureNet team.

Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Hi Roberto and Roy,

As already discussed with Roy earlier today, I found a completely separate company Azure tenant and tried to reproduce the situation there in a new VNET with the same steps as mentioned in my mail from the 4th of July but I actually could not reproduce the problem there and the child domain was created without issues!

It seems a separate VNET in our acceptance tenant was not enough isolation and the problem has to be related to some setting/networking for our tenant (and most likely our production tenant).

As Roy mentioned we can for now probably rule out that this is Windows related, but we would definitely like to look into what is causing this with the Azure Networking team.

I will have a deeper look into possibly related changes on our end (earlier I was not able to directly link any changes) and hope the Networking team can give some further suggestions.

Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Hi Roberto,
 
Thanks for the update! I just gave it another go on standard Azure Windows Server 2022 images by clicking through the AD DS configuration wizard with the credentials set as "tst.loc\henk"; unfortunately it gives the same result and I still get the "The RPC server is unavailable" error in the interface.

I am still waiting for a reply for your request however as we are waiting we can try to troubleshoot further.

Hi Damián,

 

Thanks for the update!

 

To be clear since the 24th of April I cannot get this to work on Azure in any way; when I click in the Azure Portal to create two VM's in the same subnet and then click within those VMs with the server manager to create a root domain on one VM and a child domain to that root domain on another VM I get the exact same error. In this case I used the standard Azure Windows 2022 images as well.

Hello Jan,

 

I hope you are doing fine!

 

I missed the last mail from the Azure portal, thanks a lot for sharing it again. I will take a look at the logs you uploaded and try to give you an update as soon as possible.

 

Related to the part of the mail where you told us that the standard images work fine, can you confirm to me if you ran the same script and it worked? Or did you deployed this machines manually with a normal deploy method?

Hi Damián,

 

Last week I replied to your e-mail in the ticket in the Azure Portal, but I'm not entirely sure if that reply reached you as intended.

 

The answers to your questions from my response in the Portal from last week:

- The code mentioned was based on Microsoft documentation as for example found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/install-a-new-windows-server-2012-active-directory-child-or-tree-domain--level-200-

- I can reproduce the exact same problem/error message also by clicking together both a root and a child domain on two VMs with the 'Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard' from the Server Manager (as shown in the link above also) with the images and conditions described in my earlier messages in this incident

- Our set-up worked fine before the 24th of April with the standard Windows Server 2016/2022 images

 

I also added a zip-file with the dcpromo and dcpromoui logfiles to the Portal and some extra information for the error "The RPC server is unavailable" given:

DCPromo.General.54,Microsoft.DirectoryServices.Deployment.PowerShell.Commands.InstallADDSDomainCommand

Would you have an idea on how we can best progress with this issue?

Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Hello Jan,

Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support. My name is Damián Martínez and I am the Support Professional who will be working with you on your support request. You can reach me using the contact information in my signature.

You have requested to be contacted by email only. However, if you would like to discuss your issue by phone at any time please provide a phone number and let me know when is the best time to call.

I understand that the issue is related to problems when you try to create and deploy a root domain and a child domain using an script. To begin working on your support request could you please provide the below information:
 

    This script that you mentioned, can you explain me exactly from where you took it? I mean, it was given to you from the Microsoft team or it appears in any official documentation?
    If you deploy manually with the same ISO’s the root and child domain it works properly? The issue only appears when you try to deploy everything using the script?
    This script worked in any previous time?

Hi Damián,

 

Thanks for the update!

 

To be clear since the 24th of April I cannot get this to work on Azure in any way; when I click in the Azure Portal to create two VM's in the same subnet and then click within those VMs with the server manager to create a root domain on one VM and a child domain to that root domain on another VM I get the exact same error. In this case I used the standard Azure Windows 2022 images as well.

 

Kind regards,

Jan Hein Lever

Hello Jan,

 

I hope you are doing fine!

 

I missed the last mail from the Azure portal, thanks a lot for sharing it again. I will take a look at the logs you uploaded and try to give you an update as soon as possible.

 

Related to the part of the mail where you told us that the standard images work fine, can you confirm to me if you ran the same script and it worked? Or did you deployed this machines manually with a normal deploy method?

 

Kind regards,

Hi Damián,

 

Last week I replied to your e-mail in the ticket in the Azure Portal, but I'm not entirely sure if that reply reached you as intended.

 

The answers to your questions from my response in the Portal from last week:

- The code mentioned was based on Microsoft documentation as for example found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/install-a-new-windows-server-2012-active-directory-child-or-tree-domain--level-200-

- I can reproduce the exact same problem/error message also by clicking together both a root and a child domain on two VMs with the 'Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard' from the Server Manager (as shown in the link above also) with the images and conditions described in my earlier messages in this incident

- Our set-up worked fine before the 24th of April with the standard Windows Server 2016/2022 images

 

I also added a zip-file with the dcpromo and dcpromoui logfiles to the Portal and some extra information for the error "The RPC server is unavailable" given:

DCPromo.General.54,Microsoft.DirectoryServices.Deployment.PowerShell.Commands.InstallADDSDomainCommand

Would you have an idea on how we can best progress with this issue?

Kind regards,
Jan Hein Lever

Would you have an update on how we can best proceed with this?

For the full context here in the Portal, I sent the following reply to the last question on Tuesday by mail:

Hi Support,

Would you have an update or an idea on how we can best proceed with this problem?

Unless we are really doing something specifically strange on our Azure VNET´s I would expect this situation to be quite easy to reproduce with two newly created Windows Server 2016/2022 VM's in the same subnet in any Azure subscription.

For some extra information: the full error from Powershell with some extra context (as mentioned I get the exact same error when creating the child domain by clicking through the Server Manager):

Install-ADDSDomain : The operation failed with the following error:
The RPC server is unavailable.
At line:2 char:1
+ Install-ADDSDomain `
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Install-ADDSDomain], DCPromoExecutionException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DCPromo.General.54,Microsoft.DirectoryServices.Deployment.PowerShell.Commands.InstallADDSDomainCommand

I will upload a zip-file with the c:\\windows\\debug folder with the dcpromo and dcpromoui logs of a new reproduction this morning to this request as well.

Kind regards,

Hi Support,

Would you have any idea on what could be the issue for this case or if we may have misconfigured something somewhere?

I have tried several other things, all of these on two VMs in the same subnet with the local firewalls switched off:
- older images, 20348.1487.230106 from January for 2022-datacenter
- different images, 2022-datacenter-azure-edition-smalldisk
- different manual DNS settings instead of dns only on NIC of child dc (root dc on 127.0.0.1 and child dc on IP of root dc etc.)
- adjusted flags in the Powershell commands used
- manually clicking in the Server Manager to create a root- and child domain
- checked all services/registry keys that are generally involved with the error 'The RPC server is unavailable.' and they all seem ok

But in all of these cases I keep getting the 'The RPC server is unavailable.' error when creating the child domain.

Kind regards,

2. for this reproduction of the problem I have run the code from a Powershell ISE after deploying both VMs (as seen in the screenshots)
3. please find enclosed the earlier uploaded screenshots
4. I can reproduce the problem with both the latest versions of the standard Windows Server 2016 and 2022 smalldisk images, image SKUs:
